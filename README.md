A simple battle tracking system for Dungeons &amp; Dragons written in JavaScript to track initiative and damage.

## Description

I originally built this as an experiment after finishing [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos)' [ES6 for Everyone](https://es6.io/) course to test my newfound JavaScript knowledge, put some of the things he talked about into practice, and to scratch my own itch; at the time I had just started running a D&D campaign for my kids.

After completing his [CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/) course, I decided to revisit this again to add some much-needed styling and layout.

Finally, continuing my JavaScript education, I took his [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com) course and rebuilt the entire thing in [React](https://reactjs.org/). This time, I refactored some things that were obviously missing, like the ability to retain character info after a battle is done. Finally, I put the whole thing on GitHub pages behind a custom subdomain ([battletracker.jazzsequence.com](https://battletracker.jazzsequence.com)).

## Roadmap
These are things I plan (or at least _hope_) to implement in the future.

* Accessibility
* Actual SWA
* Allow encounters to be reset without losing data
* Initiative randomizer (define initiative rather than entering rolled values)
* Attack options (each character/monster has their attacks & damage listed so dealing damage can be done by just clicking the button next to that attack type)
* Unit tests and linting
* More?
