A simple battle tracking system for Dungeons &amp; Dragons written in JavaScript to track initiative and damage.

## Description

I originally built this as an experiment after finishing [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos)' [ES6 for Everyone](https://es6.io/) course to test my newfound JavaScript knowledge, put some of the things he talked about into practice, and to scratch my own itch; at the time I had just started running a D&D campaign for my kids.

After completing his [CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/) course, I decided to revisit this again to add some much-needed styling and layout.

Next up is integrating browser storage ~and possibly refactoring as a React app~.

## Roadmap
These are things I plan (or at least _hope_) to implement in the future.

* Accessibility
* Use browser storage to retain party data after refresh
* Allow encounters to be reset without losing data
* Initiative randomizer (define initiative rather than entering rolled values)
* Attack options (each character/monster has their attacks & damage listed so dealing damage can be done by just clicking the button next to that attack type)
* Unit tests and linting
* More?

## Changelog

### 0.2.0
* added build tools
* added styling and layout
* some minor tweaks to initiative tracker and messages
